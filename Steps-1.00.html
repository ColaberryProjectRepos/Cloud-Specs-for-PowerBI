<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif">Before we go any further let us first start with what a cloud service is. A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a&nbsp;server of a cloud computing&nbsp;provider as opposed to a on-premise servers provided by a company itself. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;services provider.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif">Power BI gives the customers the ability to use both on-premise and cloud databases. The cloud server makes it possible to scale up or down according to the needs of the business. The cloud also makes data processing and data transferring a more efficient and easy process by optimizing resources on demand. Depending on how many compute nodes you purchase from Microsoft in Power BI, some of them can be on standby in case of failover and dedicated for this purpose. You also have the capability of refreshing data within the cloud server multiple times during the day to always have the latest data at hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
