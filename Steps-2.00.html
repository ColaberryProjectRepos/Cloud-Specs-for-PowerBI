<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif">Power BI offers different plans to suit different business needs. Power BI Server is a free application that introduces the features of Power BI and its capabilities of creating reports, dashboards, and various visualizations. When it comes to sharing these features to others, it is only possible with Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium. If you are only working with Power BI Pro the data limit is 10GB but with Power BI Premium, you can easily expand the capacity with different premium capacity plans. So, to simplify this let us break this into three parts. Power BI Server account itself is restricted to on-premise databases with the capability of being moved to the cloud, Power BI Pro account allows users to store up to 1 GB on the cloud server and the performance is efficient but restricted due to shared- capacity, meaning the computing power is shared with other companies within the server therefore not getting the full extent of the resources. The data on the server can be refreshed during the day and with a shared capacity workspace like in the case of Power BI, the max refreshes per day is limited to eight. &nbsp;Now with a Power BI Premium account, users are able to buy different capacity nodes, meaning a business can buy dedicated capacity that will allow for there data to use the most out of its resources and buy more nodes for additional resources. Additionally, the dedicated capacity not only speeds up processing and data migration but also allows up to 48 refreshes to data per day.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
